# 📜 Code of Conduct

Welcome to this personal project! While this repository is **not open for external contributions**, maintaining consistency and professionalism environment still matters.

## 🧭 Project Ethos

This project is built with:

- 🧠 **Curiosity** — Exploring new tools and technologies (Flutter + FastAPI).
- 🛠 **Structure** — Following clean coding practices and maintainable architecture.
- 💸 **Frugality** — 100% designed for **free-tier infrastructure** (e.g., AWS free credits, Supabase, GitHub Actions, etc.).

##  Coding Conventions

To ensure code clarity and self-discipline, the following rules apply across the stack (both Flutter & FastAPI):

### 🐍 Python (FastAPI Backend)

- ✅ All `import` statements are grouped at the **very top** of each file.
- ✅ **3 blank lines** between imports and the first function/class.
- ✅ **2 blank lines** between function definitions.
- ✅ Functions over ~10 lines or with conditional logic must include **docstrings** (`"""Explains purpose, args, returns"""`).
- ✅ Any code marked for later refactoring/review uses clear **`# NOTE:` comments**.
- ✅ Stick to [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) wherever reasonable — with some personal style.

###  Dart (Flutter Frontend)

- ✅ Use meaningful widget names — no `MyWidget1`, `MyWidget2` stuff.
- ✅ Use `const` constructors where possible.
- ✅ Always group `import`s properly: Dart first, Flutter packages next, then third-party libs.
- ✅ UI code must use **consistent spacing and padding**, with responsiveness in mind.
- ✅ Maintain modular widget/component structure (`/widgets`, `/screens`, `/models`, etc.).
- ✅ Use `///` for documentation-style comments where needed.
